# CacheMan
A Python interface for managing dependent caches.

'Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop'

## Description
This module acts as a dependency manager for caches and is ideal for instances
where a program has many repeated computations that could be safely persisted.
This usually entails a DB layer to house key value pairs. However, such a layer
is sometimes overkill and managing a DB along with a project can be more effort
than it's worth. That's where CacheMan comes in and provides an interface
through which you can define savers, loaders, builders, and dependencies with
disk-based defaults.
